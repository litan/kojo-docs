# Kojo documentation

[![Build Status](need a build status badge for the website)
[![GitHub release](need a badge for the latest release of Kojo on github)

Welcome! This repository houses all of the assets required to build the [Kojo website and documentation](Link to be updated). We're very pleased that you want to contribute!

## Contributing to the docs

You can click the **Fork** button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. This copy is called a *fork*. Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you are ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request to let us know about it.

Once your pull request is created, a Kojo reviewer will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback.  As the owner of the pull request, **it is your responsibility to modify your pull request to address the feedback that has been provided to you by the Kojo reviewer.**  Also note that you may end up having more than one Kojo reviewer provide you feedback or you may end up getting feedback from a Kojo reviewer that is different than the one originally assigned to provide you feedback. Furthermore, in some cases, one of your reviewers might ask for a technical review from a [Kojo tech reviewer](need a list of tech-reviewers in github) when needed. Reviewers will do their best to provide feedback in a timely fashion but response time can vary based on circumstances.
